FIREBASE SECURITY RULES & INDEXES DEPLOYMENT GUIDE
==================================================

STEP 1: Deploy Firestore Security Rules
---------------------------------------
1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: "expance-tracker-2af20"
3. Navigate to "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
4. Click on the "Rules" tab
5. Replace the existing rules with the content from "firebase-security-rules.txt"
6. Click "Publish" to deploy the rules

STEP 2: Create Firestore Indexes
--------------------------------
1. In the same Firestore Database section
2. Click on the "Indexes" tab
3. Click "Create Index" for each index listed in "firebase-indexes.txt"
4. For each index:
   - Enter the Collection ID (e.g., "expenses")
   - Add fields with their sort order (Ascending/Descending)
   - Click "Create"

STEP 3: Deploy Storage Security Rules
-------------------------------------
1. Navigate to "Storage" in the left sidebar
2. Click on the "Rules" tab
3. Replace the existing rules with the Storage rules from "firebase-security-rules.txt"
4. Click "Publish" to deploy the rules

STEP 4: Verify Deployment
------------------------
1. Test the app functionality to ensure rules work correctly
2. Check the Firebase Console for any rule violations in the "Usage" tab
3. Monitor the "Indexes" tab to ensure all indexes are built successfully

SECURITY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:
------------------------------
✅ User authentication required for all operations
✅ Users can only access their own data
✅ Data validation for all document types
✅ File upload restrictions (size and type limits)
✅ Proper field validation for expenses, goals, and vouchers
✅ Protection against unauthorized data modification
✅ Optimized query performance with composite indexes

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------
- Index creation may take several minutes to complete
- Test all app functionality after deploying rules
- Monitor Firebase usage to ensure rules are working as expected
- Keep backup of previous rules before deployment
